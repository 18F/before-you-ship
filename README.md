**As of June 21, 2021, the Before You Ship content has been entirely merged into the [TTS Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/#launching-software). It has also been rebranded as `Launching software` so as to convey that the tips enclosed should be looked at earlier than right before software is shipped. For more information about this change, see the relevant [GitHub issue](https://github.com/18F/before-you-ship/issues/421).**
