## Laws

### Security

#### [ATO, Authority to Operate]({{ site.baseurl }}/ato/)

A review process designed to ensure the security of public government sites. See [our security guide](https://hub.18f.gov/private/standards/security/) (internal only).

##### Triggers

This is required for public websites. You should check with Noah at the beginning of any project so he can help start this process. You should also check in with him periodically as any new features or languages are added to the project.

### Information Collection

#### PRA, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980

Designed to reduce the government forms and paperwork required of private businesses and citizens.

* Requires a minimum 90-day process before collecting information from the public.
* Does not apply to collection from fewer than 10 people or Federal employees.
* The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) must approve your survey questions. Exceptions do apply.
* This should not interfere with most forms of user research and usability testing.
* _Majma is a good contact for this and there is a dedicated Slack channel for any questions._

##### Triggers

Asking 10 or more members of the public the same questions.

##### Additional Resources

* [Memo on _Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork
Reduction Act_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/SocialMediaGuidance_04072010.pdf)
* [Page from HHS CIO](http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/policy/collection/index.html)

#### Privacy Act of of 1974 and System of Records Notice (SORN)

Regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information (PII) about people (referred to as a "system of records") by the government.

* A System of Record is created when a group of information is collected and stored in a way that can be retrieved by the name of an individual, or by any number, symbol, or other unique identifier assigned to that individual.
* The Privacy Act requires that any system of record be publicized via a SORN, which is a notice published to the Federal Register for public comment. This process lasts a minimum of 60 days.
* Further work and approval from the agency's Chief Privacy Officer may be required.

##### Triggers

You may need to develop a SORN when collecting, storing, and making retrievable people's personally identifiable information.

#### Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and the E-Government Act of 2002

When personal information on individuals is collected and used as a part of a system, the product team is required to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. The PIA explains:

* The information collected is used only for the intended purpose;
* The information is timely and accurate;
* The information is protected according to applicable laws and regulations while in GSA's possession;
* The impact of the information systems on individual privacy is fully addressed; and
* The public is aware of the information GSA collects and how the information is used.

Further work and approval from the agency's Chief Privacy Officer may be required.

##### Triggers

You may need to write a PIA or Adapted PIA for any IT system that collects, stores, and makes retrievable people's personally identifiable information.

### Accessibility

#### Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

_Bristow and Yuda are good contacts for this and they are developing training._ See the [Accessibility Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/checklist/) for a checklist.

##### Triggers

Accessibility should be incorporated and tested throughout the design and development processes.
