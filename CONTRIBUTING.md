## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), our LICENSE, and our README, all of which should be in this repository. If you have any questions, or want to read more about our underlying policies, you can consult the 18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository at https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy, or just shoot us an email/official government letterhead note to [18f@gsa.gov](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).


## Public domain

This project is in the public domain within the United States, and
copyright and related rights in the work worldwide are waived through
the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

All contributions to this project will be released under the CC0

with this waiver of copyright interest.

## Submitting / Accepting Changes

All changes should be submitted as pull requests, even by people with commit rights.  It is fine to make a branch in this repo or fork, whatever your preference.

Except for critical, urgent or very small fixes, leave pull requests open for most of the day or overnight if something comes in late in the day, so that multiple people have the chance to review/comment. Anyone who reviews a pull request should leave a note to let others know that someone has looked at it. For larger edits, we like to have a +1 from someone who has experience with the topic. Please note if you actually can verify the information, such as "sounds right" or "nice clarification" -- a +1 by itself will typically be interpreted as your thinking its a good idea, but not having reviewed in detail.

Anyone on the 18F team who believes the change is good can (and should) merge pull requests that have been reviewed and are older than 1 day. A committer can both review and merge if they are not the author of the pull request.
