Whoever **owns** a government information system must accept the risk of operating that system. Most 18F engagements, regardless of business unit, require us to operate an information system for some period of time: whether in alpha, beta, or fully live status. 

For Federal teams that support the mission of _other_ Federal agencies, it can sometimes be unclear who must accept this risk.

At 18F, we require that all of our partners agree that for 18F owned systems, 18F will enforce a risk management framework and will grant the system's **authority to operate** (ATO) based on 18F standards. If the system is transferred to the partner at later date, they will then need to issue a new ATO. This agreement provides the necessary clarity on roles and responsibilities for the system.

### Acceptance Template

Before any information system can be operated, the following memo must be signed by the requesting agency partner.

> # Acceptance of Ownership
