Just as this risk acceptance authority can be delegated within an agency (as it is from the GSA Administrator to the Associate Administrator of OCSIT to 18F), it can be delegated across agencies. Since our ATO process is far more...efficient...than the process in other agencies, delegating the ATO to us means that applications can get launched quicker without as much time and effort required for compliance.

ATOs are not a standardized concept across agencies, so each may have specific requirements for them. If an ATO is delegated to 18F, the partner agency is choosing to forego their own ATO requirements and allow 18F's Authorizing Official (Noah Kunin) to accept the risk on their behalf, using our ATO format. This is something that you should encourage your partners to accept.

Note that a signed ATO delegation is critical and urgent; it clarifies and stipulates that the agency is not the system owner...18F/GSA is. Without it, there is a lack of clarity, potentially legal in nature, on who is the customer and who is the provider of this system.

### Template

To have ATO delegated to 18F, fill out the following template and send as a PDF to your partners' Authorizing Official. When signed, place it in [the `ATOs` folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/folderview?id=0BynIxtx-CfkdckljM3BPSkdQT1U&usp=sharing) alongside your other ATO materials.
