1. Someone from the TTS Tech Portfolio will reach out to you and gain additional information
1. Once enough information has been provided, you'll be provided a `tracking number` that will be used to populate the checklist.

## Checklist Instructions - Execution Phase

1. Click on the `(TEMPLATE) Authorization Plan - [SYSTEM]`. It will popup automatically with one click.
1. Do not change anything in the `Automated Workflow & Alerts Options` or the `Data & Formatting Options`
1. Click `Use Template`

   - Remove the (Template) from the title
   - Replace [System] with your system name
1. Save sheet in [TTS System Authorizations](https://app.smartsheet.com/folders/j828W8WGxwCvqphVHqcpMQfjvPh3qPQgC65gv2R1) Smartsheet Folder. If you type `TTS system Authorizations` it show up in the file navigator.

### Setting the Checklist up

1. Select the filter for `TTS Custom Developed Software`
1. If you see a drop down from the top that says `174 out of 314 rows met filter condition` than you have completed this step properly. If you do not see that, try turning the filter off and trying again. If that is still not working, please ask what to do in #infrastructure.
1. OPTIONAL/RECOMMENDED STEP: Hide the columns in between `At Risk` and `SSP Column`.
1. Put `Tracking ID` given to you from the TTS Tech Portfolio into the grey cell next to cell that says 'ID'. This should populate the information that was gathered during the Intake Phase.
