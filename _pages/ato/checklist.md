navtitle: Checklist

To start the security clearance process, [create an issue in the `compliance` repository](https://github.com/18F/compliance/issues/new?title=ATO+for+%3Cproject%3E) - the issue template will appear there. Make sure to replace the placeholders at the top. Feel free to add a username after each task to assign it, and/or make corresponding items in your issue tracker. After the ATO issue is created, the Infrastructure Team will schedule a time to meet with you and discuss the ATO.

Make sure to leave a comment in the ATO issue when the `Project team` section of the checklist is complete and ready for review.

You are welcome to ask any questions as comments in the issue or #infrastructure.
