title: Tips

* Establish what [level](../levels/) your ATO will be.
* As soon as you have a stable server that isn’t changing its security boundary (talk to your devs about this, but it can be very early on), you should start this process. As long as there aren’t those significant changes, the tests will run periodically on any updates you make. At the very latest, start this process at least 2 months before launch. Do not commit to a launch date without coordinating with Noah Kunin on this first.
* Reach out to Noah to make sure he’s aware that you're about to start the application process (detailed below). You will know when you can set your launch date about six weeks later (likely sooner, but not reliably).
* One thing that will help the process is great documentation, which can mitigate some problems from occurring during the ATO process. Documentation, and specifically your README, should reflect a high level narrative of the architecture and data flows of the application. Questions to consider include:
    * What does it do?
    * How does it move information around?
    * What does it accomplish by doing it?
