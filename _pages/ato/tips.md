- Is your project accessible and [Section 508](../../laws/508/) compliant? The team will need to incorporate this throughout the project, but you'll also need to set up a review at least two weeks before launch.
- How good is your code test coverage? Before shipping, you should have codecov badges on your GitHub repo READMEs and coverage should be above 90 percent (green). (This is not a perfect measure for code quality, but a helpful check.) The testing working group recommends reviewing your status early and often. _Ask #wg-testing if you have questions._
- Are your APIs up to [18F's API Standards](https://github.com/18f/api-standards)? _Ask the #wg-api if you have questions._
- Make sure you have all the social media metadata and preview images.
