title: System Security Plan
---

As described in [the NIST guide](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-18-Rev1/sp800-18-Rev1-final.pdf#page=7):

> The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.

18F uses a machine-readable format for which template is below. We are also working on a tool to help generate SSPs, called [Compliance Masonry](https://github.com/opencontrol/compliance-masonry).

### System/Network Diagrams

One of the requirements for an SSP is to include a network diagram for your system. A few example diagrams can be found below:

1. [A simple application running on cloud.gov](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1f7y1nAkNfFX0MuHNB11z6bNCoNohQJ5f4s4xLr4zxds/edit)
1. [A more complex application running on cloud.gov](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LomjFFPlpIrO4i5H13ECJFVLCQ2i-nvJhiyd6IyUQYg/edit)
1. [A complex application not running on cloud.gov](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/10cH-OUB1NWzCI0v9LPzm7AXCfrHXNkDgnae-7hcUFu8/edit)

### Template

Add the following to your repository as `system-security-plan.yml`, with the information in the `<angle brackets>` filled in. It doesn't need to be 100% complete right away...only before the ATO can be signed. Once added to your repository, it should be kept up-to-date as the project progresses.
