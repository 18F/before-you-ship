In the Federal government, the principal law governing the security of information systems is the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

_**Before reading the rest of this policy**_, you should read the [readme file at FISMA Ready](https://github.com/fisma-ready/fisma-ready.github.io/blob/master/README.md), a community project co-managed by 18F. You should also take a quick glance at the [components that are already FISMA Ready](https://github.com/fisma-ready).
