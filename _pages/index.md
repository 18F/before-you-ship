The goal of this guide is to provide TTS staff with the information they need to launch software from a technical and compliance perspective. It explains requirements and best practices for projects at TTS, and the process of obtaining an ATO.

**Read this guide early and often**, especially when you're starting to consider a future project launch or feature release. **This isn't a last-minute pre-launch checklist.**
