The goal of this guide is to provide 18F staff with the information they need to launch software from a technical and compliance perspective. It explains requirements and best practices for projects at 18F, and the process of obtaining an ATO. **This site is a companion to [the Lifecycle section of 18F's Product Guide](https://product-guide.18f.gov/lifecycle-of-a-project/)**, which gives broader guidance.

**Read this guide early and often**, especially when you're starting to consider a future project launch or feature release. **This isn't a last-minute pre-launch checklist.**
