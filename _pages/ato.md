An Authority to Operate (ATO) is a complex security review process that is required before you can deploy anything on the public web. See also: [the more formal definition](https://github.com/fisma-ready/introduction#introduction).

Before a system is made publicly accessible on the Internet, it must go through either the full ATO process or a 90-Day [Limited Authority to Operate](types/). Systems can be made available for use in an extremely limited capacity if they meet the [pre-authorization criteria](types/#pre-authorization).

While the ATO is the final compliance step that's required before launching an application, you will want to **start the process as soon as possible** after your project gets off the ground.

### Starting the ATO process

To start the ATO process, follow the [walkthrough](walkthrough/).

### Federalist/Pages sites

If you are publishing a new site through [Federalist](../infrastructure/#federalist) or [18F Pages](../infrastructure/#f-pages) and it's not connecting to any APIs or third-party services (i.e. it's a simple static site), the site is considered part of that system, so does not require its own ATO ([source](https://github.com/18F/before-you-ship/issues/95#issuecomment-174011747)).

*Note: Technically, static site builders are just adding a collection of pages in an existing system. Therefore, from an ATO perspective, "sites" created through Federalist or 18F Pages remain within the respective security boundary, and thus ATO.*

### Re-authorization

If a previous ATO expires or the system changes substantively, it'll need a new ATO. Examples for triggers for a new ATO include changes to:

* Encryption methodologies
* Administrative functionality within the application
* The kinds of information you store (e.g. [personally identifiable information](../security/pii/))

The 18F Infrastructure team will make this determination â€“ please [open a new issue](https://github.com/18F/Infrastructure/issues/new?title=ATO+re-authorization+for+%3Cproject%3E?) if you think you have made a change that may require a new ATO. Even if you're not sure, doesn't hurt to ask!

To renew your ATO, go through [the checklist](checklist/), updating any existing materials.
