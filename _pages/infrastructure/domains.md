## Do you support DNSSEC?

No. [More information from cloud.gov.](https://cloud.gov/docs/compliance/domain-standards/#dnssec)

For domains owned by TTS that speak HTTP, TTS follows the requirements of [OMB M-15-13](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-13.pdf), including [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://https.cio.gov/hsts/) and the recommended additional step of [HSTS preloading](https://https.cio.gov/hsts/#hsts-preloading).

For information on how HTTPS and HSTS compensate for an absence of DNSSEC for HTTP-based services, see:

- [Why isnâ€™t DNSSEC good enough?](https://https.cio.gov/faq/#why-isnt-dnssec-good-enough)
- [How does HTTPS protect against DNS spoofing?](https://https.cio.gov/faq/#how-does-https-protect-against-dns-spoofing)

## Do you support IPv6?

Yes! [More information.](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/custom-domains/)
