When taking down a production system, [create an issue](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new?template=decommission.md&title=decommission+%5Bsystem%5D) ([preview](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/decommission.md)). Feel free to add/remove tasks as appropriate, add a username after each task to assign it, and/or make corresponding items in your issue tracker. [Here's a more extensive list](https://github.com/18F/myusa/issues/762). The [General Records Schedules 3.x](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html) are relevant, as well.

You are welcome to ask any questions as comments in the issue or [#infrastructure](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/infrastructure).
