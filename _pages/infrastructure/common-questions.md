### Do you support DNSSEC?

See:

* [cloud.gov DNSSEC information](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/custom-domains/)
### Do you support IPv6?

Yes! [More information.](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/custom-domains/)

### Do you allow "Direct Connections"?

18F does not support direct connections, either via fiber or VPN, into the cloud.gov environment. If systems launched on cloud.gov either require initial data from an internal customer system, or ongoing communications with internal customer systems that are unavailable over the public internet, we recommend working with 18F Infrastructure to devise alternatives.

### Where can I get compliance information about cloud.gov?
