The GSA Privacy Office preserves and evolves privacy protections for any individual whose personal information is handled by the agency. In practice, this requires the Office to [conduct periodic privacy threshold (or impact) analyses](https://gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=199855) for each of the GSA&rsquo;s programs and information systems. Such analyses help the Office ensure legal compliance and mitigate privacy risks.

Privacy risks are often based on to the degree to which a program or information system collects and makes use of [personally identifiable information (PII). Per [OMB Circular A-130](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf), PII is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual&rsquo;s identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.

As someone interested in shipping a product or service, you&rsquo;ll need to first **identify the agency** at which the product or service in question will obtain its authorization to operate (ATO). If that agency *not* the GSA, please skip the guidance below and instead contact the Privacy Office at the agency granting the ATO (as each agency has its own process for conducting privacy threshold and impact analyses). 

Otherwise, take the following steps:

1. [Submit a request for a privacy threshold analysis](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrhrrzgS-ZcOpS37YzLdmVXkwX_3dBefZ1t39oKcgdVepmuQ/viewform)
1. GSA&rsquo;s Privacy Office will reach out to help you collaboratively identify, discuss, and evaluate privacy risks, and to determine the ways in which they might be mitigated. It&rsquo;s important to note that this collaboration may ultimately affect the design of the product or service in question. It might also result in the creation of the following privacy-related documentation (for which templates are linked):
  - [Privacy Act Notices](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1CcVLPNNra1WCGqHewK2ojQ_ysHcGxmJ1IlsCo9pAiSU/edit?usp=drive_web)
  - [System of Records Notices (SORNs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hDIDvcTv-zplMBl_uQbg7GQ5uwrC-2Jr8xg4D073q5Y/edit)
  - [Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6FtuHPW41ZLkjXnANjZ60-sUojDexh3r3afm1yE9b8/edit#heading=h.s85zskw81fkz)
1. As you complete and receive sign off on your product or service&rsquo;s privacy-related documentation, the Privacy Office may work with you to plan for the creation of any necessary role-based training for the staff who will operate the product or service. This ensures privacy compliance in perpetuity.
