All TTS systems requiring authentication **must** use multiple factors. Examples of multi-factor authentication (MFA) include, but are not limited to:

- [**cloud.gov identity provider**](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/cloud-gov-identity-provider/)
- [**GSA SecureAuth**](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/telework-technology/secureauth) - only an option when your users have GSA ENT accounts
- [**OMB Max**](https://max.gov/) - requires an Inter-Agency Agreement
- [**Login.gov**](https://login.gov) - requires an Memorandum of Understanding for new agencies

Systems in the [pre-assessment](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/lifecycle/#conditions-for-pre-assessment) phase do not require MFA.
