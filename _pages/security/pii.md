**Sensitive PII** is information which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. While this is inherently a subjective definition, there are certain types of information we *always* treat as Sensitive PII:

* Driver's license or state identification number
* Social security number (SSN)
* Financial account number(s)
* Alien Registration Number
* Passport number
* Biometric identifiers

Because we live in an increasingly connected world, sometimes sensitive PII can be created by pairing different types of PII. These types of PII become sensitive if paired:

* Citizenship or immigration status
* Ethnic or religious affiliation
* Mother's maiden number
* Last 4 digits of SSN
* Medical information
* Sexual orientation
* Account passwords
* Criminal history
* Date of birth

Sensitive PII **cannot be on a system unless it has received an [Authority to Operate](../../ato).** If you are uncertain if the information you want to work with is Sensitive PII in your context, speak with 18F DevOps beforehand.
