title: Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
---

***...and the Privacy Act of 1974.***

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is any information that can distinguish or trace an individual, either alone or when combined with other information. **Sensitive PII** is information that, if misused, could cause substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to a person. Sensitive PII cannot be on a system unless it has received an [Authority to Operate](../../ato/). If you are uncertain if the information you want to work with is Sensitive PII in your context, speak with [the GSA Privacy Office](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/533866) or 18F Infrastructure beforehand. Some notes:

* This process is not analogous to the [PIA](../../privacy/pia/)/[SORN](../../privacy/sorn/) process – those must be handled separately and, if necessary, should be initiated as close to the start of your project as possible.
* Collecting some PII that is ancillary to your system's purpose, for example in a search box, does not necessarily trigger [the Privacy Act](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104250). If however, for example, your system is using contact information to communicate with people, it is processing PII.

### Always

While PII may dependent to some extent on context, there are certain types of information we always treat as Sensitive PII:

* Driver's license or state identification number
* Social security number (SSN)
* Financial account number(s)
* Alien Registration Number
* Passport number
* Biometric identifiers
* Passwords

### Paired

Sometimes sensitive PII can be created by pairing different types of PII. These types of PII become sensitive if paired:

* Citizenship or immigration status
* Ethnic or religious affiliation
* Mother's maiden name
* Last 4 digits of SSN
* Medical information
* Sexual orientation
* Account passwords
* Criminal history
* Date of birth

### Privacy Act Statement

You must inform people from whom PII is collected of the reason you are requesting the information; how it will be used, and what the consequences are, if any, of not providing the information. Implicit in this requirement is the notion of informed consent and your Privacy Act Statement must be accessible where the PII is collected, for example, on the webpage where the user inputs information.

When drafting a Privacy Act Statement for review by the Privacy Office, include the following elements:

* The legal authority for collecting the information – statute, executive order, regulation.
* The purpose(s) for collecting the information and how you will use it.
* A reference to the SORN that covers your system; and
* Whether providing the information is mandatory or voluntary and what the effects of not providing the information are – for example the loss or denial of a privilege, benefit, or entitlement.
