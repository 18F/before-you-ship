Government requirements for shipping projects fall into the following categories:

* Information Collection
    * [Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA)](pra/)
    * [Privacy Act of of 1974 and System of Records Notice (SORN)](sorn/)
    * [Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and the E-Government Act of 2002 (PIA)](pia/)
* Accessibility
    * [Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (508)](508/)
* FISMA
    * One of the goals of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is to “provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support Federal operations and assets.” The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was tasked with designing and implementing this framework: the result is NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). All federal information and information systems (except classified information and national security systems) are subject to NIST’s RMF.
    * There's [an introduction to the RMF on NIST's website](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/framework.html).
    * A more comprehensive guide, including how to apply the framework, references to the various relevant publications, and definitions of roles and responsibilities, is found in NIST's [Special Publication 800-37](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r1.pdf).
