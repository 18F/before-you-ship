***The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980***

Designed to reduce the government forms and paperwork required of private businesses and citizens.

* Requires a minimum 90-day process before collecting information from the public.
* Does not apply to collection from fewer than 10 people or Federal employees.
* The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) must approve your survey questions. Exceptions do apply.
* This should not interfere with most forms of user research and usability testing.
* _@rjmajma is a good contact for this, and there is a dedicated #pra Slack channel for any questions._
