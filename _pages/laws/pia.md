***Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and the E-Government Act of 2002***

When personal information on individuals is collected and used as a part of a system, the product team is required to conduct [a Privacy Impact Assessment](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/658270). The PIA explains:

* The information collected is used only for the intended purpose;
* The information is timely and accurate;
* The information is protected according to applicable laws and regulations while in GSA's possession;
* The impact of the information systems on individual privacy is fully addressed; and
* [The public is aware of the information GSA collects and how the information is used.](../../security/pii/#privacy-act-statement)

Further work and approval from the agency's Chief Privacy Officer may be required.
