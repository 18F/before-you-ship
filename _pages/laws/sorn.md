***Privacy Act of 1974 and System of Records Notice***

Regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information (PII) about people (referred to as a "system of records") by the government.

* A System of Record is created when a group of information is collected and stored in a way that can be retrieved by the name of an individual, or by any number, symbol, or other unique identifier assigned to that individual.
* The Privacy Act requires that any system of record be publicized via a SORN, which is a notice published to the Federal Register for public comment. This process lasts a minimum of 60 days.
* Further work and approval from the agency's Chief Privacy Officer may be required.

### Triggers

You may need to develop a SORN when collecting, storing, and making retrievable people's personally identifiable information.
