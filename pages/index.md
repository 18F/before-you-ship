This list is a general guide to review periodically, especially when you are starting to consider a potential future launch. It is not a comprehensive pre-launch checklist because many of the items listed here _should_ be completed well before launch. But just in case, here are some things to review. It's very much a work in progress, and we'll probably reframe and reorganize.

* Are your project's details up to date on the [18F Dashboard](https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard)? _The Dashboard team recommends you update this monthly, at a minimum._
* Is [SSL](https://github.com/18f/https) enabled for everything? (Does everything start with https?)
* Review the [18F Guides](https://guides.18f.gov), especially:
  * [18F API Standards](https://github.com/18f/api-standards) _You can also talk to the API working group (#wg-api) if you have questions._
  * [Analytics Standards](https://github.com/18F/analytics-standards) (Google Analytics and [DAP](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/)) _You can also talk to the analytics working group (#wg-analytics) if you have questions._
  * Content
  * Open Source Style Guide (Good documentation and README)
* Once you have reviewed everything here, the DigitalGov team has collected a list of [Requirements for Federal Websites and Digital Services](http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/checklist-of-requirements-for-federal-digital-services/) that you should familiarize yourself with. We recommend reviewing this last, because many of the requirements are explained or managed in the above guides and processes.
