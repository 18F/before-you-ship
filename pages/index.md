title: Introduction

This list is a general guide to review periodically, especially when you are starting to consider a potential future launch. It is not a comprehensive pre-launch checklist because many of the items listed here _should_ be completed well before launch. But just in case, here are some things to review. It's very much a work in progress, and we'll probably reframe and reorganize.

* Are your project's details up to date on the [18F Dashboard](https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard)? _The Dashboard team recommends you update this monthly, at a minimum._
* 
* Once you have reviewed everything here, the DigitalGov team has collected a list of [Requirements for Federal Websites and Digital Services](http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/checklist-of-requirements-for-federal-digital-services/) that you should familiarize yourself with. We recommend reviewing this last, because many of the requirements are explained or managed in the above guides and processes.
